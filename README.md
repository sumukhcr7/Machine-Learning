# Machine-Learning

### The purpose of this work is to predict the success of a terrorist attack using approaches in machine learning. The research was carried out on the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), an open database which contains a list of terrorist activities. Eight machine learning algorithms have been applied on some selected set of features from the data set to achieve an maximum accuracy of 93%.

The algorithms implemented are :
## 1. Random Forest
## 2. K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
## 3. Linear Regression
## 4. Linear Discriminant Analysis
## 5. Decision Tree Classifier
## 6. Naive Bayes
## 7. Support Vector Classifier
## 8. Logistic Regression

Out of all the above mentioned algorithms Random forest proves to be the most effecient.
